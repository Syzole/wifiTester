# This is a work in progress

This is a Python script meant to simplify and test networks using both built-in functions and external packages.

For now, it only supports WiFi speed testing, but plans to implement WiFi scanning to see what devices are on a network are in the works.

## Installation
To install please run the pip command:
```bash pip install speedtest-cli```

Then clone this repository and run the script. 

Stay Tuned and Enjoy!
